# AGENTS.md — The documentation standard

This file defines document structure, Markdown tiers, writing rules, and `verify-doc-budgets` ceilings. It applies to human-facing documentation; [Agent Notes](../.agents/notes/README.md) keep their own format.

## Document structure

A document's subject and tree position fix its scope: describe its own subject at appropriate detail and direct children only by purpose, responsibility, and high-level behavior; link to the owning descendant for lower-level detail. Testing mechanisms, fixtures, and harnesses belong at the lowest owning level; higher documents link there.

Classify every in-scope document as a tutorial or reference. Tutorials follow an ordered path to an outcome and introduce only what each step needs. References define a lookup scope and current behavior without a teaching sequence. Separate substantial tutorial and reference content; label a section when either part is small.

Before writing a tutorial, privately classify the reader's starting knowledge and each concept as beginner, intermediate, or advanced. Establish prerequisites before dependent concepts, increase difficulty gradually, and move unnecessary advanced material to a later tutorial or reference.

Author in this order: locate the document in the tree; set its permitted detail; choose tutorial or reference; for a tutorial, order concepts by prerequisite and difficulty; relocate descendant-owned detail; replace lower-level explanations with links to their owners.

## The tier taxonomy: one home per fact

Each fact has one home: the tier whose job it is; elsewhere, link there.

| Tier | Job | Does NOT belong there |
|---|---|---|
| Root `AGENTS.md` | Standing orders: rules an agent needs in context in every session, one to three lines each, linking its home | Stories, worked examples, situational procedures, anything restated from a linked home |
| Subtree `AGENTS.md` (`docs/`, `.agents/notes/`) | Orders specific to that subtree | Repo-wide rules the root file already carries |
| [architecture.md](architecture.md) | Ordered map: composition, core modules, extension points; read before changing source | Per-module detail (→ module READMEs), decision rationale (→ Agent Notes) |
| [Agent Notes](../.agents/notes/README.md) | Active decision records: the why, what-was-given-up, and required verification; `implemented/` notes describe shipped reality in present tense | Migration plans, acceptance-task checklists, and spec-speak ("should…") once the decision has shipped |
| [postmortem/](postmortem/README.md) | Incident stories — the only tier where war-story narrative belongs | — |
| [cookbook/](cookbook/responding-to-pr-review-on-a-stack.md) | Step-by-step how-tos with numbered verify steps | Design rationale (→ the Agent Note each guide links) |
| Module README | The per-module contract: config, semantics, limitations, extension points | JSDoc restatement, other modules' concerns |
| Generated reference | Exhaustive sources regenerated from source and freshness-gated, where the project adopts generators | Hand edits to generated regions |

Placement: bugs → postmortems; rationale → Agent Notes; procedures → cookbooks; module contracts → READMEs; standing orders → root `AGENTS.md` with a rationale link.

## Writing rules

- **Document current state.** Keep history in commits, PRs, Agent Notes, or postmortems. Other prose names live mechanisms, not changes or stack positions.
- **Apply the Agent Note creation criteria.** Mechanical/local edits are exempt; keep existing owning notes accurate ([scope](../.agents/notes/README.md#when-to-write-one)).
- **One physical line per paragraph** (`verify-md-wrap`): use editor soft-wrap. Code blocks, tables, and list structure keep their formatting.
- **Comments and JSDoc state complete contracts, not reasoning transcripts.** Preserve behavior, failure, timing, ownership, modality, exceptions, consequences, and non-obvious orientation; delete narration, test walkthroughs, review analysis, and code restatement. Keep the local contract and link its rationale. Use [prose-standard](../.agents/skills/prose-standard/SKILL.md) for details.
- Write directly: name actors and facts. Name the exact check, type, API, operation, or behavior instead of metaphorical labels a reader must decode.

## Wordcount budgets

[scripts/doc-budgets.manifest.json](../scripts/doc-budgets.manifest.json) sets standing-doc ceilings; `pnpm run verify-doc-budgets` rejects excess or missing files.

When the gate goes red:

1. **Relocate** content that belongs in another tier; leave a one-line link if needed.
2. **Condense** content that belongs here but can be shorter.
3. **Raise** the ceiling only when the words need the space; justify the manifest diff in the PR. A too-low ceiling is a budget bug.

Ceilings are guardrails, not reduction targets. At or below target, retain at least 5% headroom; above target, freeze the ceiling until relocation or condensation brings the document under target. Lower a ceiling only when the document still has room. Review governs unbudgeted tiers.

## The slop checklist

Hunt these in any doc; [prose-standard](../.agents/skills/prose-standard/SKILL.md) runs this list as an audit:

- Duplicated rules: search a distinctive phrase; keep one home and link the rest.
- History outside its permitted tier: state current facts and link the historical owner.
- Implementation-status annotations in prose or diagrams ("implemented!", "future: …"). Status rots; the repository layout and module manifests carry it.
- Hand-restated catalogs, JSDoc, or inventories when source or a generator is authoritative.
- Reasoning transcripts: step-by-step implementation narration, proof of obvious branches, test walkthroughs, or rejected local alternatives. Keep the resulting contract or durable rationale; delete the path used to derive it.
- Rationale repeated beside sibling methods instead of once at the owning capability or helper.
- Paragraph walls: one paragraph carrying several rules and parenthetical asides. Split it or demote the detail to its home.
- Emphasis inflation: bold, CAPS, or "critically" everywhere means nothing stands out. Reserve emphasis for the clause that changes behavior.
- Spec-speak in `implemented/` Agent Notes: "should", migration plans, acceptance checklists. An implemented Agent Note describes what is.

## Repository references

Use relative Markdown links for current files and tags or PR numbers for historical references. [verify-md-links](../scripts/verify-md-links.ts) checks that relative targets and anchors resolve; [verify-doc-refs](../scripts/verify-doc-refs.ts) checks documentation paths cited in TypeScript sources.
